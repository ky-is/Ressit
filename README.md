## What it is

Reddit is one of the best ways to keep up with niches and hobbies on the internet. It's also an infinitely-scrolling time-suck that insists on showing you repeating and progressively lower quality posts to try to keep you engaged.

Ressit attempts to solve these problems by adopting an RSS reader style approach to Reddit. Choose your subreddits and customize their priorities. It then loads the top posts from each *all*â€“*week* time period, with throttled updates.

Posts you view are marked as read, and dismissed when you manually reload. When you run low, Ressit will load in more once new high-quality content is available.

Ressit suggests the subreddits you subscribe to, but encourages you to curate them You can also stay signed out and add subreddits manually instead.

## What it isn't

Ressit is not a general-purpose client. It's not intended for real-time, so many features like commenting aren't supported.
